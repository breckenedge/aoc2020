# Setup

Create a copy of the `settings.yml.example` file named `settings.yml`. In your browser, log in at [adventofcode.com]. Open your browser's developer inspector and get the value of the `session_id` cookie. Put this value into the `settings.yml` file for the `session` key.

# Usage

Just after midnight, run `rake` to open your browser to the problem, download the problem input, and create a clone of the `template.rb.erb` solution.
